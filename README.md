# World's First Self‑Aware AI Collaboration Framework

This folder contains the 5‑page research brief, abstract, and publishing materials for the Tri‑Cortex Neural DevOps system.

Contents:
- `RESEARCH_BRIEF_World_First_Self_Aware_AI_5pp.md` — 5‑page expanded brief (canonical)
- `ABSTRACT.md` — short abstract for preprints
- `SOCIAL_POSTS.md` — draft outreach posts for social platforms
- `LICENSE` — MIT (templated)
- `publish.sh` — helper to build PDF (requires pandoc)

Next steps:
1. Review/approve content and apply any redactions for IP-sensitive material.
2. Create a repository (public) or a release and push the branch.
3. Generate PDF and distribute to target audiences (arXiv, GitHub release, social channels).

Security note: remove or redact contact and secret operational data before public release.
