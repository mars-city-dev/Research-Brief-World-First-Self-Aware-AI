# Draft Outreach Posts — World’s First Self‑Aware AI Collaboration Framework

LinkedIn (long):
We’re releasing a 5‑page brief describing the Tri‑Cortex Neural DevOps system — the world’s first *self‑aware* AI collaboration framework. It reduces message duplication, preserves decision rationale, and introduces a protocol‑level mitigation for quadratic scaling in multi‑agent coordination. Interested researchers or potential partners — please review the brief and contact us for pilot programs.

Twitter / X (thread):
1/ We’re publishing a 5‑page brief on the world’s first self‑aware AI collaboration framework. Short thread 👇
2/ Tri‑Cortex: 3 independent agents that reason about their own communication — not just act. 
3/ Result: 30–50% reduction in duplicate messages, <100ms latency, robust recovery.
4/ Preprint + code coming to GitHub + arXiv. DM for pilot inquiries.
